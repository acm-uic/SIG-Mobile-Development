## Team Culture and Values
Here's the type of team enviroment I'm working to build. Let me know if anyone has suggestions.

- Unity
    - Working as one, single unit and acting as one. It's almost like the team is one person, but with multiple limbs. 
    - Some people will work more than others in some phases of the development process
    - The idea is to distribute work so it is managable, without trading off quality for less effort
    - Which means you are putting in less effort as an indvidual, but the app being made is still a robust one
      
- Leadership
    - Everyone should strive to be a leader.
    - Creativity and discipline are greatly valued.
    - Work to bring yourself to the top, and take everyone around you for the ride.
      
- Flexibility
    - A lot of us are nearing the end of college, and this means, not much free time
    - With this in mind, a lot of the work we do can be done at your own time
    - I cannot guarantee no deadlines, but you can be sure you will know well in advance if something needs to get done
    - Work that's flexible to your schedule is a top priority

- Competitiveness
    - Challenge ourselves and others in the team and work to get the best experience and skills
    - By no means will we fight amongst ourselves, but the idea is to push each other to greater heights

- Mentorship
    - We are very lucky to have a lot of seniors in our group, and they have a lot of wisdom
    - A lot of us are just starting app development, so don't hesitate to reach out to your lead or a senior when in trouble
    - If Stack Overflow fails, we're here

- Joy
    - Of course, there has to be a reward when we work hard
    - Progress is a obvious one, but there's also friendships and mentorships
    - This club is about growing, and even if it is painful at times, growing is joy

   
## Preview of Our Development Process
It goes without saying that any major undertaking requires planning beforehand. That is especially true for mobile development. I speak from experience when I say, you're headed for disaster if you don't plan out all your components, screens, backend, etc before you touch the keyboard. 

For that reason, I gathered information on the process of app development with extensive research. 

Here are the basic steps I found, we'll be using this process for all our projects. The goal is to give us a basic idea to work with while still allowing flexibility and creativity with the app.

### Step 1: Discovery
- Roles involved:
  - Everyone
 
Let the creativity flow! This is the stage where...
  - Creatively inclined people
        - Find an idea that's not already on the market
        - Research possible selling points and features -- What do we have that others don't?

  - Analytically inclined people
        - Research potential databases/APIs/libraries that can be used to make the app -- Ex. If we make a book app, how will we get the book info? Local database? API?
        - Scout out possible competition -- what features do they have?
