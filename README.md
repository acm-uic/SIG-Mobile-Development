## Team Culture and Values
Here's the type of team enviroment I'm working to build. Let me know if anyone has suggestions.

- Unity
    - Some people will work more than others in some phases of the development process
    - The idea is to distribute work so it is managable, without trading off quality for less effort
    - Which means you are putting in less effort as an indvidual, but the app being made is still a robust one
    - Team members make up for each other's shortcomings
      
- Leadership
    - Everyone should strive to be a leader.
    - Creativity and discipline are greatly valued.
    - Leads will have the flexibility to work in any way they want to achieve the result, each team will be its own entity with its own way of doing things.
    - Work to bring yourself to the top, and take everyone around you for the ride.
      
- Flexibility
    - A lot of us are nearing the end of college, and this means, not much free time
    - With this in mind, a lot of the work we do can be done at your own time
    - I cannot guarantee no deadlines, but you can be sure you will know well in advance if something needs to get done
    - Work that's flexible to your schedule is a top priority

- Mentorship
    - We are very lucky to have a lot of seniors in our group, and they have a lot of wisdom
    - A lot of us are just starting app development, so don't hesitate to reach out to your lead or a senior when in trouble
    - If Stack Overflow fails, we're here

## Reason for a management tree
A management tree is established so that not every problem goes to one person. If you have any problem or doubt about how to do things, you can be directed to the multitude of people in the tree to have it cleared. 

A heirarchy is established to keep things efficient and not to overwhelm any one person.

## Preview of Our Development Process
It goes without saying that any major undertaking requires planning beforehand. That is especially true for mobile development. I speak from experience when I say, you're headed for disaster if you don't plan out all your components, screens, backend, etc before you touch the keyboard. 

For that reason, I gathered information on the process of app development with extensive research. 

Here are the basic steps I found, we'll be using this process for all our projects. The goal is to give us a basic idea to work with while still allowing flexibility and creativity with the app.


### Step 1: Discovery
- Roles involved:
  - Everyone
 
Let the creativity flow! This is the stage where...
  - Find an idea that's not already on the market
  - Where is the future headed? What kind of app leverages that? What trends can we hop on | Can we create a new trend?
  - Research possible selling points and features | What do we have that others don't?

---


### Step 2: Planning
- Roles involved:
  - Everyone

We have a great idea, but is it possible? This is the stage where...
  - Research potential databases/APIs/libraries that can be used to make the app | Ex. If we make a book app, how will we get the book info? Local database? API?
  - Are there any problems that will arise if we proceed with the creation of the app? | Ex. Limitations with the coding language/library we'll be using
  - What features will there be available on the app?
  - What platform will we be using?
  - Any other problems?

> [!NOTE]
> If we can't find solutions to the problems we think of, we go back to Step 1


---


### Step 3: Design
- Roles involved:
  - Designers
  - Managers and Leads
  - Anyone who'd like to pitch in on design

Now we visualize it. This is the state where...
  - We draw up the screen visuals to help us see what we want
  - All screens will be drawn by designers
  - Everyone pitches in and requests changes to the designers


---


### Step 4: Backend
- Roles involved:
  - Backend lead
  - Backend team
  - Managers and Leads

We figure out how we make it work behind the screens. This is the stage where...
  - What backend functions are required for the actions taken by the user in the frontend?
  - How can we use the database to achieve this result?
  - Code the backend and all functions
  - Make them easily readable for the rest of the team


---


### Step 5: Frontend
- Roles involved:
  - Frontend lead
  - Designers
  - Fullstack lead
  - Frontend team
  - Managers and Leads

It's time to work off the hard work of the backend programmers. This is the stage where...
  - Screens are established
  - Designer is consulted to see if everything looks good, or additions are required
  - Button presses are connected to backend functions
  - Everything on the UI and UX is taken care of
  - Fullstack lead goes through the code and finds errors if there is a problem between connecting the frontend and backend


---


### Step 6: Testing
- Roles involved
  - Everyone

The app's done! But is it really? This is the stage where...
  - Tester goes through every screen and uses every feature
  - Tester tries to use the app in different devices to see if the screen changes dynamically based on available screen space

> [!NOTE]
> If the tester(s) find any problems, they direct them to the appropriate team/lead so it can be solved



---


### Step 7: Publication
- Roles involved
  - Everyone

Now the app's really done. This is the stage where...
  - We go through the publication process to get our app published
  - Marketing, if necessary. We go on social media and tell everyone that new app is available
  - Obviously, if we build an app for an organization such as UIC or someone else, the organization will take care of spreading the word
