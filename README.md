## Team Culture and Values
Here's the type of team enviroment I'm working to build. Let me know if anyone has suggestions.

- Unity
    - Working as one, single unit and acting as one. It's almost like the team is one person, but with multiple limbs. 
    - Some people will work more than others in some phases of the development process
    - The idea is to distribute work so it is managable, without trading off quality for less effort
    - Which means you are putting in less effort as an indvidual, but the app being made is still a robust one
      
- Leadership
    - Everyone should strive to be a leader.
    - Creativity and discipline are greatly valued.
    - Work to bring yourself to the top, and take everyone around you for the ride.
      
- Flexibility
    - A lot of us are nearing the end of college, and this means, not much free time
    - With this in mind, a lot of the work we do can be done at your own time
    - I cannot guarantee no deadlines, but you can be sure you will know well in advance if something needs to get done
    - Work that's flexible to your schedule is a top priority

- Mentorship
    - We are very lucky to have a lot of seniors in our group, and they have a lot of wisdom
    - A lot of us are just starting app development, so don't hesitate to reach out to your lead or a senior when in trouble
    - If Stack Overflow fails, we're here

   
## Preview of Our Development Process
It goes without saying that any major undertaking requires planning beforehand. That is especially true for mobile development. I speak from experience when I say, you're headed for disaster if you don't plan out all your components, screens, backend, etc before you touch the keyboard. 

For that reason, I gathered information on the process of app development with extensive research. 

Here are the basic steps I found, we'll be using this process for all our projects. The goal is to give us a basic idea to work with while still allowing flexibility and creativity with the app.


---


### Step 1: Discovery
- Roles involved:
  - Everyone
 
Let the creativity flow! This is the stage where...
  - Find an idea that's not already on the market
  - Where is the future headed? What kind of app leverages that? What trends can we hop on | Can we create a new trend?
  - Research possible selling points and features | What do we have that others don't?
  - Research potential databases/APIs/libraries that can be used to make the app | Ex. If we make a book app, how will we get the book info? Local database? API?
  - Are there any problems that will arise if we proceed with the creation of the app? | Ex. Limitations with the coding language/library we'll be using
  - What features will there be available on the app?

### Step 2: Design
- Roles involved:
  - Designers
  - Managers and Leads
  - Anyone who'd like to pitch in on design

We have an idea. Now we visualize it. This is the state where...
  - We draw up the screen visuals to help us see what we want
  - All screens will be drawn by designers
  - Everyone pitches in and requests changes to the designers

### Step 3: Backend
- Roles involved:
  - Backend lead
  - Backend team
  - Managers and Leads

Now we figure out how we make it work behind the screens. This is the stage where...
  - What backend functions are required for the actions taken by the user in the frontend?
  - How can we use the database to achieve this result?
  - Code the backend and all functions
  - Make them easily readable for the rest of the team
